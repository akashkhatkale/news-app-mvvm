# news-app-mvvm
News app created with Android Studio, Kotlin, MVVM, Coroutines, Retrofit, Navigation Component and Room database.
Added pagination in News Fragment.

1) News data is fetched by using Retrofit from https://newsapi.org/
2) Used MVVM to separate UI from the application logic, and to persist data if device rotates.
3) Used coroutines to deal with asynchronous code.
4) Navigation component is used with one activity and four fragments.
5) Room database is used to store saved news on device locally.
